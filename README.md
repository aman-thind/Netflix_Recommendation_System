Content-based filtering is commonly used for recommender systems. It treats recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on an item's features. In this system, it tries to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past, or is examining in the present and the best-matching items are recommended. This uses information retrieval and information filtering.
